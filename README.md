## Additional Information

Here are some additional details about the project dependencies:

- **spring-boot-starter-web**: This starter provides the necessary dependencies for building web applications using Spring MVC. It includes the embedded Tomcat server and other components required for web development.

- **spring-boot-starter-thymeleaf**: Thymeleaf is a popular templating engine for server-side rendering in Spring MVC applications. This starter includes Thymeleaf and its dependencies, allowing you to use Thymeleaf templates in your web application.

- **flyway-mysql**: Flyway is a database migration tool that helps manage database schema changes over time. This dependency specifically adds support for MySQL databases in Flyway.

- **lombok**: Lombok is a library that helps reduce boilerplate code in Java classes. It automatically generates getter, setter, and other common methods at compile-time, making your code more concise and readable.

- **mysql-connector-java**: This is the JDBC driver for MySQL databases. It enables your Java application to connect to a MySQL database server and perform database operations.

- **spring-boot-starter-test**: This starter provides dependencies for testing Spring Boot applications. It includes frameworks and libraries like JUnit, Mockito, and Spring Test for writing unit tests and integration tests.

- **spring-boot-starter-validation**: This starter includes the necessary dependencies for using JSR 380 Bean Validation API in Spring applications. It enables you to validate input data and enforce business rules using annotations and validation constraints.

- **hibernate-validator**: Hibernate Validator is the reference implementation of the JSR 380 Bean Validation API. It provides additional validation capabilities beyond the standard API and integrates seamlessly with Spring Boot.

- **spring-data-jpa**: This dependency is part of the Spring Data project and simplifies the implementation of JPA repositories. It provides a high-level abstraction for working with databases using the Java Persistence API (JPA).

- **spring-boot-starter-data-jpa**: This starter combines the dependencies required for using Spring Data JPA with Hibernate as the JPA provider. It includes the necessary libraries for database access, entity management, and transaction management.

- **annotations**: The JetBrains annotations library provides additional annotations for code analysis and documentation purposes. These annotations can be used to improve code quality, enforce contracts, and generate documentation.
